[21:30, 2/5/2019] Stuart Mesham: Well that's the thing. We have to get our Jammy tracking system up and running and feed our predictions into it. [21:32, 2/5/2019] Stuart Mesham: So we're basically having to technically achieve most of what those other guys did but instead of the fancy please-download-me app + user accounts etc. the users just hit this webpage and they see everything they really care about when they're on their way to the jammie stop, right? [21:35, 2/5/2019] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, apart from our real-time predictions I think this is actually a lot easier to read and access the official schedule. Also html5 we can request their location (if they allow once it becomes a saved automatic preference I think) and show the stop they're closest to straight away. [21:36, 2/5/2019] Stuart Mesham: *than the official... [21:41, 2/5/2019] Stuart Mesham: Also I know Boyd has a much more ambitious project in mind. I think the train-station board is a pretty good MVP though. It also doesn't prevent us from carrying on once we've got it running and eventually do Boyd's whole idea. This is basically just a very simple interface but the backend is the same as what we would do with Boyd's.
