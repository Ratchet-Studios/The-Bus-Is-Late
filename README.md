# The Bus Is Late
Well that's the thing. We have to get our Jammy tracking system up and running and feed our predictions into it. So we're basically having to technically achieve most of what those other guys did but instead of the fancy please-download-me app + user accounts etc. the users just hit this webpage and they see everything they really care about when they're on their way to the jammie stop, right?  Yeah, apart from our real-time predictions I think this is actually a lot easier to read and access the official schedule. Also html5 we can request their location (if they allow once it becomes a saved automatic preference I think) and show the stop they're closest to straight away.  Also I know Boyd has a much more ambitious project in mind. I think the train-station board is a pretty good MVP though. It also doesn't prevent us from carrying on once we've got it running and eventually do Boyd's whole idea. This is basically just a very simple interface but the backend is the same as what we would do with Boyd's.
